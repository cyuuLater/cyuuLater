# Hi there 👋
I am an undergrad Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of California, Merced, expected to graduate this semester. My current focus is on full-stack web development, with a growing interest in integrating data analytics or computer science education. I am also motivated to expand beyond my scope within mobile app development.
